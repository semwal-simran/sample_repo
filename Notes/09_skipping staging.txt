do as follows--

modify a previous file..
git status
git add .

create a new file 
git status

now...
one will be in mmodified area (previous)

another will be in untracked area(new)

now.. to skip staging for the  new one use--

git commit -a -m "Direct Commit"
(This will move all tracked files to staging area and then commit)

it won't commit untracked files
