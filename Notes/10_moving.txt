if we rename a file.. then for git it is deleted and a new one is created 

but when we add it to staging area it then clearly shows that the file was renamed

after commit
git rm were.txt

if we do m anually then we have to use git add too 

this command removes and stages


RENAME
 syntax---git mv old name.txt new name.txt

 git mv hello.txt renamed.txt
---moves to staging area as well

now doing this...
create new file
add to staging area 
then add to git ignore
then modify it 
u'll find that it is still being tracked...
to avoid this situation use---
[git rm --cached ignore.txt]
